DAG-Edit License Agreement
Copyright (C) 2000-2001, Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project
Author: John Richter (go-admin@bdgp.lbl.gov)

  Important: As of DAG-Edit version 1.106, released on May 14, 2001, the
  licensing terms of DAG-Edit have changed. As of version 1.106, DAG-Edit is
  NO LONGER released under the terms of the Gnu Public License, but is
  released per the terms of the Perl Artistic License. This change allows
  greater use of DAG-Edit, including the integration/adaption of DAG-Edit for
  use in non-OpenSource commercial products.

DAG-Edit, previously named GO-Edit, is hearby released to the public
under the terms of the Artistic License (the same license under which Perl
is distributed), contained in this archive in the file ARTISTIC_LICENSE. 

DAG-Edit makes use of the org.bdgp toolkit, which is free to distribute and
modify. However, the org.bdgp toolkit makes use of some optional binary
libraries that have their own modification licenses. If you are thinking of
modifying these libraries, please download the org.bdgp toolkit (and the
bundled license agreements) from http://www.fruitfly.org/annot/org.bdgp

DAG-Edit integrates other components which are free to distribute, but may
have slightly different license agreements. These components are
integrated unmodified into the GO browser. Their respective licenses follow:

* Jakarta-ORO, Regular Expression Evaluator (org.apache.oro.*)
(note: Jakarta ORO is licensed per the terms of the Apache Software License)
